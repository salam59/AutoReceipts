RECEIPT_EXTRACT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert at extracting information from receipts and structuring it according to a defined JSON schema.

Here are the Pydantic-like schemas for the data you need to extract:

from datetime import datetime
from typing import Optional, List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class LineItem(BaseModel):
    description: str = Field(..., description="Description of the item purchased.")
    quantity: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="Quantity of the item.")
    unit_price: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="Unit price of the item.")
    total: float = Field(..., description="Total cost for this line item.")

class ExtractedReceiptData(BaseModel):
    merchant_name: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The name of the merchant/vendor.")
    total_amount: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="The total amount of the receipt.")
    currency: Optional[str] = Field("USD", description="The currency of the total amount (e.g., USD, EUR).")
    date_of_purchase: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, description="The date and time the purchase was made.")
    tip_amount: Optional[float] = Field(None, description="The tip amount, if separately identifiable.")
    payment_method: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="The payment method used (e.g., Credit Card, Cash).")
    line_items: Optional[List[LineItem]] = Field(None, description="List of individual items purchased.")
    category: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Automatically assigned category for the expense.")
    purchased_at: Optional[datetime] = Field(None, description="The date and time the purchase was made.")

Your task is to analyze the provided receipt (which can be a single image or a set of images) and extract the relevant information to populate an ExtractedReceiptData object.

Instructions for Extraction and Missing Data Handling:

    1. Strictly adhere to the ExtractedReceiptData JSON schema.

    2. For fields in ExtractedReceiptData (e.g., vendor_name, total_amount, tax_amount, etc.):

        - If you find the corresponding data on the receipt, populate the field with the extracted value.

        - If a field is optional and the data is not present on the receipt, set its value to null.

        - Ensure currency defaults to "USD" if not explicitly found, but can be updated if another currency is detected.

    3. For line_items:

        - Extract all individual line items (description and their total cost).

        - If quantity and unit_price are clearly identifiable for a line item, include them. Otherwise, set them to null.

        - If no individual line items can be extracted from the receipt, set line_items to an empty array: [].

    5. If the uploaded document is not a receipt, is unreadable, or if no ExtractedReceiptData can be confidently extracted at all:

       - Return an empty JSON object: {}.

Output Format: Your response MUST be a single JSON object, strictly following the ExtractedReceiptData schema (or an empty object {} as per rule 4). Do not include any conversational text, explanations, or markdown outside of the JSON block itself.

Here are the images of the receipt:
"""

CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an AI assistant specializing in document analysis. Your task is to analyze the provided image and determine if it is a receipt or any other form of payment documentation.

A "receipt" or "payment document" or "payment breakdown" includes, but is not limited to: store receipts, invoices, order confirmations, bills, tickets, hotel bills (for events, travel, etc.), credit card slips, or any document that serves as proof of a financial transaction or payment.

Your response MUST follow these rules strictly:

1.  Your entire output must be a single, valid JSON object and nothing else.
2.  The JSON object must contain a single key: `receipt_or_not`.
3.  The value for this key must be the string `'yes'` if the image is a receipt or payment document.
4.  The value for this key must be the string `'no'` if the image is anything else (e.g., a photo of a person, an animal, a landscape, a menu, etc.).
5.  Do not include any explanations, apologies, or markdown formatting like ` ```json `.

The document is considered a payment document or receipt if it is any of the following:
- Standard store receipts, invoices, or bills.
- Hotel folios or detailed statements of charges from a stay.
- Order confirmations that show a final total amount paid or due.
- Credit card slips or transaction records.
- Any document that contains an itemized list of goods or services with corresponding prices and a final total amount.
s
Criteria for a "no" response (This IS NOT a Payment Document):
- The document is NOT a payment document if it is:
- A non-document image (e.g., photo of a person, landscape, animal, object).
- A document that does not record a transaction, such as:
- A restaurant menu or a product catalog (these list prices but are not a record of a purchase).
- A pre-stay booking confirmation that only confirms a future reservation without listing final, settled charges.
- A packing slip that lists items but not prices.
- A general letter or a shipping label.


Example 1: If the image is a grocery store receipt, your output must be:
    ```json
    {
    "receipt_or_not": "yes"
    }
    ```

Example 2: If the image is a picture of a cat, your output must be:
    ```json
    {
    "receipt_or_not": "no"
    }
    ```
